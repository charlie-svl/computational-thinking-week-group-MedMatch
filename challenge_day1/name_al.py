They all had different classes and regrouped after school. Once school was over, Name_6 had to go for his therapy appointment due to his prior experiences with his dad. The others played together while they waited for him."

They are occupied with university classes, due to this, they barely have time to participate in leisure activities together. Name_4 and Name_6 no longer talk to each other any more, this is because they had a fight in grade 11 over who had the most bands."
